# BMI-Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration.

# BMI introduction

BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.

# BMI table for adults
This is the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended body weight based on BMI values for adults. It is used for both men and women, age 20 or older.

Classification	            BMI range - kg/m2
Severe Thinness	                   < 16
Moderate Thinness	               16 - 17
Mild Thinness	                   17 - 18.5
Normal	                         18.5 - 25
Overweight	                      25 - 30
Obese Class I	                    30 - 35
Obese Class II	                  35 - 40
Obese Class III	                   > 40

# BMI table for children and teens, age 2-20
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends BMI categorization for children and teens between age 2 and 20.

Category	                 Percentile Range
Underweight	                     <5%
Healthy weight	               5% - 85%
At risk of overweight	         85% - 95%
Overweight	                      >95%
